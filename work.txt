add fb login
    login goes on button push

add localstorage of already voted
    if voted than a second button click will remove vote choice

add socketio for live update
    -worry about or fix the problem with insecure actions being fired

change store to Map, not List using id. 
    Maybe quicker retrieval since no comparison function required.
    But not a problem unless app starts to grow


add timestamp and removal process
    -possibility one:
        date.now on client will send local time and timezone in minutes.
        save timezone
