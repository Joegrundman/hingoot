need to auto remove if self is going

add localstorage of already voted
    if voted than a second button click will remove vote choice
        -- actually not sure if this is needed now
        -- we can use client internal state to control already voted

add socketio for live update
    -worry about or fix the problem with insecure actions being fired

change store to Map, not List using id. 
    Maybe quicker retrieval since no comparison function required.
    But not a problem unless app starts to grow


add timestamp and removal process
    -possibility one:
        date.now on client will send local time and timezone in minutes.
        save timezone
        server crawls through store every hour and deletes all entries whose localtime = 0400

add possibilty of identifying fb friends who are going to the same place
    - is there a webapi for this?
    -possibility1: save a list of all friend id-s and user id with every upvote(makes object get quite big!)
                if matching friends ids, sends data about matching friends
    -possibilty

on webpage
    remove functionality from navbar except signout from facebook

add jwt login service for non fb users?
    could be hassle, but statefull jwt means we don't need to store server details
    -- not necesary, just removed fb requirment ads option


app close button
    --this is not needed since is not an app
    --unless want to make an app
